## lectureStudio

lectureStudio is a open and royalty-free software for e-teaching with support for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. It offers a multitude of possibilities: This starts with the presentation of PDF-based slide sets, including the possibility of pen annotations and digital whiteboards. These two features for use in interactive teaching scenarios (classroom, lecture hall) are enhanced by a quiz system with which surveys can be carried out very easily, in which the audience can participate directly by using own mobile devices in accordance with GDPR without the use of special apps or external servers. For remote teaching, recordings and bandwidth-saving live streaming are integrated directly into the software.
